## Compile instructions

If is your first time using the project, you will just need to:

```
make build
```

But if you already used it, it's better to run:

```
make clean
make build
```

## Running instructions

It's just:

```
./main ${NAME}
```

**${NAME}:** It's the **file.aag** that you want to use as input. Example:

```
./main C432
```
All the **.aag** files are in **input** folder.
